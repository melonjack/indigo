My name is Riley Testut, and I make apps.

I've been developing for iOS for 8 years now, starting with my very first app [Shoot Around](https://github.com/rileytestut/Shoot-Around), which I released when I was 13 for iPhone OS 3. Since then, I've worked as an independent developer on several other projects, but I'm most well known for my work on [GBA4iOS](http://gba4iosapp.com), a Game Boy (Advance) emulator for non-jailbroken iOS devices, as well as my upcoming emulator [Delta](http://deltaemulator.com), which will support even more game systems such as SNES and N64.

In addition to working as an independent developer, I've also worked with or for a couple of companies. Previously, I was the lead iOS developer at [Ponder](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/ponder-app-anti-social-media), where I wrote the majority of the code for our native iOS app from scratch, and before that I interned at [Bottle Rocket](http://www.bottlerocketstudios.com/index.html), where I worked with a number of teams on developing iOS apps for various clients.

On a more personal level, I'm currently a 21-year-old senior at the University of Southern California, where I'm studying Computer Science. My passion is and always will be writing code, but I also love both making and watching movies, and spent the majority of high school making short films with friends as part of my school's film program. Oh, and I also love Nintendo games, which probably won't come as a surprise given the projects I've worked on.
