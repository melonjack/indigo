As [Paul Thorsen](https://twitter.com/pau1thor) and I have been alluding to on Twitter, development of GBA4iOS 2.1 is moving forward as strong as ever, and with us graduating from High School next week, we'll be able to start working on the update full-time. Because we are closer than ever to finishing the update, we wanted to do something to thank you for downloading and enjoying GBA4iOS, as well as help pass the time until GBA4iOS 2.1 is finally available.

Until the update is released, Paul and I will be revealing surprises every few days or so, with the goal of building up excitement for the long-requested multiplayer feature in GBA4iOS. Today, we'll start by releasing a documentary I made for school over my developer career, with an emphasis on GBA4iOS. While it was only a school project, and I treated it as such (many of the voiceovers were done the night before the project was due), I feel it still gives a good insight into what goes on behind the scenes of GBA4iOS, and hopefully you all will find it interesting as well. Some parts are somewhat outdated, but rather than update the documentary to account for these, I opted to leave the project in its original form, with only a few minor modifications (which you will notice when you watch).

So, without further adieu, here it is: [Riley Testut - A Self-Documentary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtWjjbei-vE).

Remember, this is just the start of many surprises we have in store. If you want to make sure you don't miss out on what else we have planned, make sure to follow [@pau1thor](https://twitter.com/pau1thor) or [@rileytestut](https://twitter.com/rileytestut) on Twitter, as we'll be posting all our news there. And as always, thanks for downloading and enjoying GBA4iOS; we do what we do because of the support we get from all of you!
