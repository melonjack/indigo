When I selected beta testers for GBA4iOS, I [wrote about how difficult it was to choose from several hundred applicants](http://rileytestut.com/blog/2013/09/08/the-results-are-in/). While that was certainly true, it pales in comparison to this time. For this beta test, we expected another several hundred applicants, maybe even over a thousand, but these turned out to be severe underestimates. Less than 30 minutes after opening up submissions to beta test Delta, we had received over 150 responses, and less than a day later that number had soared to over 1000. So, how many applications did we receive after seven days?

*10,165*. Wow.

After an entire weekend of reading applications, we narrowed them down to 80 general testers and 40 press testers, for a total of 120 beta testers. Additionally, of those 80 general testers, seven submitted promotional artwork that will be used to promote Delta in the coming weeks. I could write more about how really, incredibly difficult (and long!) this process was, but since I think y’all just want to know who was chosen, I’ll skip all that.

So, ready to find out who was chosen to beta test Delta? Here they are!

Congratulations to everyone who was chosen! We’ll reach out to all of you by email shortly, and we’ll also send the very first beta out later tonight. For those who weren’t selected, remember that Delta will be free for everyone when it is released, so you’ll still be able to enjoy all your favorite classic games at that time.

Sincere thanks to all of you that applied, as well as my fellow judges [Caroline Moore](https://twitter.com/1carolinemoore), [Maddie McCarthy](https://twitter.com/MaddieMcCarCar), [Grant Gliner](https://twitter.com/GrantGliner), and [Matias Franco](https://twitter.com/matiasafranco), without whom this process would have been near-impossible. Finally, stay tuned for more info on Delta, as there is still plenty more I have yet to reveal!
