[Just over two weeks ago][1], I (finally) wrote up the complete instructions on how to create custom GBA4iOS controller skins. One of the driving forces behind custom skins was to see what ideas people could come up with, so after posting the instructions I mentioned a competition where everyone could submit their designs, and the best ones would be featured in GBA4iOS for download.

Well, that competition has ended, and here are the results (ranked in no particular order.) All the skins you see below are now available for download within GBA4iOS, so if you see one you like, make sure to go download it!

## Wrap-Up

Thanks to everyone who entered the contest; it was awesome to see all your ideas! Remember, if you didn't get picked this time, you can always submit to [GBA4iOSkins.com][3], and they may host your skin for you so others can download it. And for those select few who were chosen, congratulations; you earned it!

Hopefully, these skins will inspire you all to create even more skins of your own, and I can't wait to see what you come up with!
