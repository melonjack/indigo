I'm just going to come out and say it: picking a select few beta testers out of hundreds was incredibly difficult. While it initially seemed like I would be able to do this alone, the emails kept coming in faster than I could read them. To compensate for this, I asked my friend [Paul Thorsen](http://twitter.com/pau1thor) to help me sort through all the emails. Don't worry, I still saw every email, but with Paul helping I was able to finish even quicker than I thought. Because of this, make sure to thank him for his hard work! (Or if you weren't selected, feel free to blame him.)

Anyway, I know you all are anxiously awaiting the results of this entire process, so I'm writing up two separate blog posts: this one you're reading now with the results themselves, and another coming up soon describing what happened behind the scenes and other small tidbits I wish to share. It was originally going to be combined into one big blog post, but since the latter would take longer to write I decided to write and publish them separately. 

So, ready to find out who has the privilege of beta testing GBA4iOS 2.0? Here they are!
